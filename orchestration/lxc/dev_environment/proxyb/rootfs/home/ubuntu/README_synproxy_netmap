Juha-Matti Tilli has developed a Layer-2 transparent SYNPROXY implementation via Netmap.
The script is available under the name ```synproxy_netmap.sh```

The service has been demonized and can be also started via ```systemctl start synproxy_netmap```.
It can also be run manually via ```/home/YOURUSERNAME/synproxy/synproxy/nmsynproxy netmap:wan0p netmap:wan0```.
